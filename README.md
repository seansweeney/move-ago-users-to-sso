# Move ArcGIS Online users to SSO
Move everything we know about one ArcGIS Online user to another account.  
This script was originally created to migrate users from ArcGIS Online logins to enterprise Single Sign-On logins (SSO), which is where it gets its name, but it should also work for AGOL-to-AGOL or SSO-to-SSO migrations.  
For more details on how the script works see my [NEARC 2019 presentation](https://github.com/seansweeney/NEARC-2019).
